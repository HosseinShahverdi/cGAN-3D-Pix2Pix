# MedNifti_3D_Pix2Pix
Synthesizing 3D PET/CT images from CT/PET ones.

## Description

Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are both medical imaging techniques that allow doctors to view the inside of the body.

A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of the body, while a PET scan uses radioactive tracers to produce images of the body's tissues and organs. CT scans are typically used to visualize the structure of the body's organs, while PET scans are used to visualize the function of the body's organs.

Both CT and PET scans can be used to diagnose a wide range of medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. They are often used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests to help doctors make a diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.
